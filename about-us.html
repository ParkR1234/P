                                                    <p> As a member of the BPA's Approved Operator Scheme, Park Right Services have the ability to obtain the information from the DVLA</p>

                                                    <h5>When will I hear back from my appeal?</h5>
                                                    <p>Park Right Services aim to respond to appeals as soon as possible, this can take up to one month. Rest assured, your ticket charge value will remain the same until dealt with. </p>

                                                    <p>Park Right Services follows procedure from the BPA code of practice, where if the registered keeper can report whom the driver at that period was, funds may be recovered from the driver.

                                                     <h5>What happens if I ignore the charge?</h5>
